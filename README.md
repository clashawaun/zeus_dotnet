Designed and developed a system to manage a warehouse environment. The system handles all aspects of the procurement process, from processing items when they arrive at a warehouse, to shipping an order to a customer.

In addition to the server application which manages the warehouse, an online store which allows users to place orders for processing was created. This website uses the Orion Identity Management system for authentication.

The project was a proof of concept implementation. I will continue to add features going into the future.
